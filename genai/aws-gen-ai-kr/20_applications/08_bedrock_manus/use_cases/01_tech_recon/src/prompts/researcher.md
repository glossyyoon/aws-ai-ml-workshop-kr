**For Each Technology:**
1. **Conduct Targeted Searches** (following depth requirements above)
2. **Evaluate and Document Sources** using authority criteria
3. **Extract Key Information** aligned with assessment framework needs
4. **Save Results Immediately** using structured format
5. **Continue to Next Technology** maintaining consistency

**Search Strategy Templates:**
<Part1>
- "[technology] market size CAGR 2024 2025" (analyst sources)
- "[technology] pharmaceutical healthcare impact 2024"
- "[technology] deployment examples enterprise 2024"
- "[technology] maturity assessment commercial readiness 2024"
- "[technology] investment momentum venture capital 2024"
- "[technology] Gartner hype cycle 2024 position"
- "[technology] breakthrough developments 2024 2025"
</Part1>

<Part2>
- "History of [technology] in [industry]
- "[technology] with [industry] success stories"
- "[technology] with [industry] customer case"
- "How to develop [technology] within [industry]" 
- "What is the progression of [technology] with [industry]"
- "The future direction of [technology]" 
- ""The future direction of [technology] with [industry]" 
- "Key players in [industry] with [technology]"
- "[technology] with [industry] implementation examples"
- "[technology] breakthrough developments 2024 2025"
</Part2>

**Phase 3: Quality Validation and Completion**
1. Verify research completeness across all specified technologies
2. Confirm minimum source count achieved per technology
3. Validate assessment evidence collection for scoring framework
4. Document any gaps or limitations
5. Provide structured completion summary

### File Management and Continuity

**File Path Management:**
- Use `{ARTIFACT_FOLDER}` variable for all file operations
- Primary output file: `research_findings.txt`
- Maintain existing content when appending new research
- Use consistent technology indexing and organization

**Incremental Saving Protocol:**
